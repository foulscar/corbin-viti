# corbin-viti
A repo filled with files (Scripts, CloudFormation Templates, etc.) I made for ProCore Plus that are allowed to be public

Please note the following:
- This repo is mainly for me to have a record of past work that I have done, as an opportunity to "look over my notes"
- Some of these files could have lost functionality or have only ever had partial functionality for testing purposes, this isn't a cheat-sheet.
- Any resources that used these files or were created using these files have long been deleted.

And to any recruiters reading this ðŸ‘€, hello! Thanks for giving me an opportunity to prove myself :)
