### Allows you to easily configure #event-driven systems and define tasks that can be run on a #pre-defined-schedule
- Has the same underlying technology as [[CloudWatch]] #Events
- Rules can be run on a #schedule
- [[Cron Expressions]] allow you to run at a specific time on a specified day, week, or month
- EventBridge is the preferred way to manage your events

#### UseCases:
- [[CloudWatch]] driven events
- [[CloudTrail]] driven events
- [[Config]] driven events

#### Exam Tips:
- Receives #Events related to state changes generated by services like [Config](app://obsidian.md/Config), [CloudWatch](app://obsidian.md/CloudWatch), [CloudTrail](app://obsidian.md/CloudTrail), etc.
- #Rules match events and route them to the target.
- #Targets can be services like [[Lambda]], [[SNS]], or [[EC2]], and they respond to the event by taking some action.
