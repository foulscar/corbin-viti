#### Elasticity
- Scale with demand (SHORT TERM)
- EX: multiple instances
#### Scalibility
- Scale out infrastructure (LONG TERM)
- EX: changing instance type

#### Vertical Scaling
- ###### Increasing Machine or System Capacity
- ###### Increases cost of systems
- ###### Decreases cost of admin overhead
	- Disk I/O
	- Storage
	- CPU
	- Memory

#### Horizontal Scaling
- ###### Adding Instances to Share Load
- ###### Decreases cost of systems
- ###### Increases cost of admin overhead
	- Adding instances or nodes
	- Adding load balancers
	- Using Auto Scaling Groups
	- Making the application multi-AZ
